          <p class="float-right mb-4" style="max-width: 500px;">Hello, my name is Eileen Xu and I am a student at Dublin High School. My personal career goal is to become a chemical engineer. I plan to do this by taking courses in mathematics, chemistry, physics, biology, and engineering throughout high school and college. Being a chemical engineer is my career choice because I enjoy learning about chemistry and I would like to apply that knowledge to design and build instruments.<br><br>I have experience in labs from taking biology honors in my freshman year and also from going to my dadâ€™s workplace as he is a chemical engineer. By watching him work, I realized that being a chemical engineer is something that I could seriously pursue.<br><br>Last year, I did some volunteer work for Grassroots Ecology and Save the Bay, both for habitat restoration. These experiences taught me how to be diligent, organized, and reliable. It was hard and grueling work at times, but I enjoyed being there and I learned many valuable lessons.<br><br>Thanks for taking time out of your day to read this and I hope that you enjoy exploring the rest of my site.</p>
